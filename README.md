Art503-Project

Using Unity as the game engine.

Coded in C#.

Concept:

Stone Keep is a 2D action platformer featuring four playable characters that have united to fight back against the evil that terrorizes their home. Together they use their unique skills to defeat the great evil. The goal of the player is to navigate the stages and defeat enemies so they can confront the final antagonist to save the kingdom.

Story:
    The eldest son of the royal family ascended to power through bloodshed and treachery, and plunged the kingdom into a period of darkness and war. He was usurped and exiled by his younger brother, but has festered with hatred and jealousy, believing himself to still be the rightful heir to the throne. Having allied himself with monsters and magical forces, he has returned to the castle to seize control, and our heroes, who remember the bloody past, are determined to stop him from throwing their home into chaos once again.

Unique movement speed 
Unique movement ability

Levels:

The levels in Stone Keep function in a layer system, wherein the game is all one level and the player progresses by reaching the next layer of the keep, ending with the final boss fight on layer three. 

Layer 1

The first layer of the game is meant to give the player a simple introduction to the game. Platforming on this layer is generally quite simple and enemy placements are low. There are opportunities for characters to use their skills to their advantage and progress through the level faster. Some small pitfalls can lead the player to a quick end, but are quite easily avoidable to help the player get their bearings. The game ramps up its required platforming difficulty at the end of this layer with a jumping puzzle. This puzzle requires the player to scale a small section of the keep by jumping back and forth between small platforms. Although it does not appear that complex it requires some precise movement to get passed. Once the player reaches the end of this puzzle they arrive at the next layer. 

Layer 2

Layer Two holds more challenges for the player. It has a greater amount of enemies to fight or pass with platforming. The platforming is still not too difficult on its own, but the higher number of enemies makes it need to be done fast to not face defeat. On this layer false blocks are introduced. These are blocks that allow the player to pass through them, which can place the player in dangerous situations or have to redo sections of the game if not spotted. False blocks are distinguishable by their darker coloring and are avoidable if the player is paying attention. At the end of this layer the player is faced with another seemingly simple jumping puzzle to complete in order to reach the next layer. This puzzle is a series of floating blocks placed like a set of winding stairs. There is just enough space between each step for the player to fall through and need to restart if they are not careful. If the player should get ahead of themselves they can easily have to do the puzzle again requiring patience to pass this seemingly simple stairway. The player can also choose to go past this stairway and have an easier climb to the next layer with a wall jumping puzzle for the Archer. 

Layer 3

Layer Three holds more challenge in combat than in platforming. This layer is split between the boss area and a smaller platforming section similar to the previous two layers but littered with many enemies for the space given. The player is forced to decide to fight through the enemies or risk the platforming in order to preserve hearts for the boss fight at the end. This layer is also filled with false blocks which can send the player promptly back to layer two and more danger if they were not able to clear out the enemies there. The player eventually comes to a super mario-esque staircase that drops them into the boss area. Once here they will use the platforms provided to avoid the bosses attacks and land the killing blow claiming victory.
